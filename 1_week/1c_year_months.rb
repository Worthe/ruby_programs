# Using what we have learned so far: I wonder if anyone could have a crack at
# working out the age in years and months form. For example “I’m 32 years and 6
# months old.” Use the following values for age_in_seconds:`
# doctest: age in seconds converted to months
# >> seconds_to_months(315_360_00)
# => 12.00
#
# 979000000
#
# 2158493738
#
# 246144023
#
# 1270166272
#
# 102560009
#
def seconds_to_months(seconds)
  puts 23
end
